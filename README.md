This Task Management App allows users to manage tasks using the Dummy JSON API. Users can view a list of tasks, create new tasks, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, and view detailed information about individual tasks. 


Fetch Tasks: Fetch tasks from the API and display them in the main view.

CRUD Operations: Implemented functionality to create, update, and delete tasks using the API.

Task Status Management: Tasks are categorized into three statuses: To Do, In Progress (locally managed), and Done.
State Management

Redux Toolkit: Utilized Redux Toolkit for managing the local state of tasks, including handling API interactions and synchronizing state changes.

React Router: Implemented basic routing with react-router-dom to navigate between the home page and task detail view.

Media Queries: Applied media queries to make the app responsive across different screen sizes.

Mobile-Friendly Layout: Adapted task display to stack columns vertically on smaller screens.
